  1. Discussion Code.R
  This component is used to generate the dataset which scientists wish to compare the relationsip among WuHan-HU-1, SARS-CoV-2 variants and          MERS-CoV sequences.

  2.Mutation Template.py

The codes above serve as a template which other users can use to mutate the sequences based on the rule on that A will be converted to G, G will be converted to A, T will be converted to C and C will be converted to T.

  3.Mutation of Sequence.py

Complete codes for mutation of an entire MERS-CoV sequence
