Files:

Discussion Code.R 
This component is used to generate the dataset which scientists wish to compare the relationsip among WuHan-HU-1, SARS-CoV-2 variants
and MERS-CoV sequences.

Mutation Template.py
The codes above serve as a template which other users can use to mutate the sequences based on the rule on that A will be converted to G,
G will be converted to A, T will be converted to C and C will be converted to T.

Mutation of Sequence.py 
Complete codes for mutation of an entire MERS-CoV sequence
