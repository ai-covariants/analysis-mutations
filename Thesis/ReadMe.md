## Code

1. Discussion Code.R

This component is used to generate the dataset which scientists wish to compare the relationsip among WuHan-HU-1, SARS-CoV-2 variants and          MERS-CoV sequences.

2. Mutation Template.py

The codes above serve as a template which other users can use to mutate the sequences based on the rule on that A will be converted to G, G will be converted to A, T will be converted to C and C will be converted to T.

3. Mutation of Sequence.py

Complete codes for mutation of an entire MERS-CoV sequence

4. Discussion.py

In this section, Principal Component Analysis,t-SNE and UMAP are used to reduce the dimensions while retaining most information of the datasets. Subsequently, the visualization is produced to examine the relationship between various isolates.

## Results

1. Discussion 

This folder consists of dimensional reduction result generated from Discussion.py

3. T-SNE for Mutation

This folder comprises of t-SNE dimensional reduction approach using dataset from Mutation of Sequences

4. UMAP for Mutation

This folder contains UMAP, a novel dimensional reduction method, using dataset from Mutation of Sequence
